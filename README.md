Schedules
=========

A Symfony project created on December 22, 2016, 2:05 pm.

This is a quick scheduling app that involves user login in which a user can create his/her own schedule. I made this as a short project in a few days.

WARNING: Would recommend not using a password that you use often! This is a student project so I am not sure how secure the website is.
